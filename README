README

This is simply a copy of the code written by Alexander Hofbauer grabbed from his
blog at http://derhofbauer.at/blog/blog/2012/08/28/logitech-performance-mx/ on
September 28, 2013. The reason is that I found the code useful and would like to
offer it others in a simple way.

Running `make` in the top directory should give you the executable.
